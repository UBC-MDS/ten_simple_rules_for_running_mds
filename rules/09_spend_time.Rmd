Make sure students are given ample opportunity to interact with faculty. One of the main reasons students enroll in a Data Science program is to interact with faculty. While it is resource-intensive to allocate large amounts of "contact hours" between faculty and students, it is critical. In our program, each course has 3 hours of associated lectures per week and 2 hours of associated lab time per week, for a total of 5 hours/week. Our labs are staffed by a faculty instructor and multiple TAs. Furthermore, the cohort of ~100 students is divided into two lab sections, with ~50 students in each. From the student perspective then, each week of class consists of 12 lecture hours, 8 lab hours, 4 optional faculty office hours, and 15-20 optional TA office hours. 

Beyond simply the number of hours, be sure to designate part of the time with a label other than "lecture". Although "lecture" time may be used in a variety of ways, including active flipped classroom approaches, the label itself sets expectations for a highly structured, efficient class time. It is important to have times that do not feel rushed, when students can take time to formulate their questions, ask them, seek clarification, consult their peers, and also simply get to know each other and the faculty. To facilitate these types of interactions, if possible seek to schedule your non-lecture time in flat-floor classrooms with tables and chairs. The sloped lecture theatre configuration is not conducive to collaboration or mingling.
