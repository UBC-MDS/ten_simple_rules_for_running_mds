Teach current data science concepts, methods and tools.
Data science has its roots in computer science and statistics, 
but modern data science can be viewed as its own interdisciplinary field 
with its own distinct emphasis, applications, workflows, tools, and culture.
This means that building a data science program likely means that new courses
will need to be built from scratch. 
Selecting a subset of pre-existing statistics and computer science courses, 
to create a data science program, will create one in name only,
and will in reality be a combined statistics and computer science degree. 
Such a program will lack the distinct aspects of data science that have 
evolved from it's parent fields. 
In our program we created all of the courses from scratch.
This is not to say that we took nothing 
from courses in the parent fields of data science.
A good deal was taken, however, much of the emphasis, workflows and tools 
needed to be changed.
We also needed to add new topics that have arisen from the field of data science,
which are absent from the parent fields (e.g., FILL IN ...).

Data science is distinct from it's parent fields is that 
data science is primarily an applied field, 
and most students who graduate from a data science program 
move on to working outside academia.
As such, when teaching data science concepts, methods and tools, 
it is critical to teach them in the context of answering real world
questions using rich, real data sets. 
An additional consequence of students primarily turning into applied,
data science practitioners upon graduation is that the curriculum needs to be
kept modern and current to help them be successful on the job market.
At the time of writing this (and likely for many years hereafter), 
continual effort is needed to evolve data science educational materials
to keep up with the fast evolving pace of the field. 
In our program, we build this expectation into the culture of our teaching team, 
as well as budget time and money for this.
Culturally, we assign a certain number of courses as targets for redevelopment
when it becomes apparent that the field has changed. 
We also normalize incorporation of new tools methods in our courses, 
by doing this regularly.
When a course needs redevelopment to modernize it 
with what is happening in the field, 
we assign the instructor extra teaching credit to provide them the prep time 
to do this. 
We also provide instructors funding to attend conferences related to data science,
and time to contribute to open source data science projects.
Finally, we also listen to our alumni and our academic advisory team 
(comprised of academic, government and industry representatives) 
through surveys, and meetings to keep connected with data science practitioners 
so that we are aware of when the field is moving, and where it is moving too.
