Teach current data science concepts, methods and tools.
Data science has its roots in computer science and statistics, 
but modern data science can be viewed as its own interdisciplinary field 
with its own distinct emphasis, applications, workflows, tools, and culture.
This means that building a data science program likely means that new courses
will need to be built from scratch. 
Selecting a subset of pre-existing statistics and computer science courses, 
and to create a data science program, will create one in name only,
and will in reality be a combined statistics and computer science degree. 
Such a program will lack the distinct data science emphasis, applications, 
workflows, tools, and culture.




- Data science is an applied field, and most students who graduate a data science program move on to working outside academia
  - real data sets
- Data science is a fast evolving field
  - teach current/authentic data science concepts
