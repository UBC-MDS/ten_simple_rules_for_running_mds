Leverage your program's alumni community by connecting them with current students. Often, the best person to give advice to a student is someone who was previously in their shoes. In our program, we engage alumni in a variety of ways. All alumni (including faculty/staff alumni) are members of the UBC MDS Alumni Slack workspace, where alumni post jobs ads, ask/answer data science questions, and generally stay in touch. Beyond that, our alumni generously volunteer their time to give talks to current students (e.g. at orientation, or at an employer seminar or Capstone seminar), to participate in career-building events (e.g. conducting mock interviews with current students), to pair up with a current students as part of our mentorship program, or to partner with us for Capstone projects (it's always a delight to have MDS alumni on the other side of the table). These interactions enrich the experience for current students while also benefitting alumni. Current students receive mentorship, wisdom, and employment opportunities; alumni have an avenue to stay up-to-date on data science techniques, partner on Capstone projects, and hopefully hire some great data scientists. Once your program reaches steady state, the number of current students will stay roughly the same from year to year, but your community of alumni will always be growing. Your alumni hopefully had a great experience with your program, and will often be happy to stay connected. Eventually, the vibrant alumni community, and its associated career opportunities, may even be a draw for prospective students to apply to and select your program over other options.
