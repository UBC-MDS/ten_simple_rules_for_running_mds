The field of data science arose in part to help people make descisions based on evidence.
Thus, it follows that when teaching data science, 
evidence should also be used to select effective pedagogies.
In the beginning of our MDS program in 2016, 
there was not yet a rich literature with evidence on how to teach data science.
Instead, we borrowed from the pedagogical literature from related fields,
such as statistics and computer science.
Many of the pedagogies we have employed fall under the umbrella of active learning.
Active learning is ... and is thought to ... (ref).

Next discuss these common active learning strategies by describing and citing an original paper,
and giving a concrete example of how we use them in MDS. 
- live coding & demonstrations
- flipped classroom
- in-class worksheets
- iClicker
- group projects (don't talk about this too much in detail as we have an whole other section on it)
