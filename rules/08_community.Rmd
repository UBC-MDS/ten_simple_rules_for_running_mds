Having a respectful and supportive community 
for learners is fundamental for leveling the playing field 
across a group of heterogeneous learners - 
which is essentially any group of learners.
Learner heterogeneity may be particularly higher in a Master of Data Science 
program given that students come from a wide variety of academic backgrounds.
In a classroom where a respectful and supportive community is not built, 
only some learners who have certain privileges are likely to succeed. 
In such an unsafe environment, 
many learners lacking these certain privileges will become demotivated, 
frustrated, and feel alone. 
Their learning will suffer because of this, 
no matter how well the content is delivered by the teaching team. 

One way to scaffold a respectful and supportive community 
is to use and enforce a code of conduct 
that clearly outlines what behaviors are not acceptable in our learning spaces, 
and a process for reporting a code of conduct violation. 
Importantly, providing contact details for a secondary reporting person is 
important, in case the person listed I as the reporting person
(unintentionally) violate the code of conduct. 
- how we enforce the code of conduct - publicly but respectfully

Other ways we do this in MDS:
- careful choice of data sets (e.g., not using iris, calling out limitations
on how data has been collected - sex and gender are not binary, using diverse 
data sets that diverse people can identify with)
- learn students names
- announce when we make mistakes, **show our human-side**

- D&I workshops/Ally skills workshops - professional training

- team work document
