Put significant effort into creating a respectful and supportive community. 
Any group of learners has some level of heterogeneity,
and establishing a respectful and supportive community for learners 
is fundamental for levelling the playing field 
across a group of heterogeneous learners.
Learner heterogeneity may be particularly higher in a Master of Data Science 
program given that students come from a wide variety of academic backgrounds.
In a classroom where a respectful and supportive community is not built, 
only some learners who have certain privileges are likely to succeed. 
In such an unsafe environment, 
many learners lacking these certain privileges will become demotivated, 
frustrated, and feel alone. 
Their learning will suffer because of this, 
no matter how well the content is delivered by the teaching team. 

One way to scaffold a respectful and supportive community 
is to use and enforce a code of conduct 
that clearly outlines what behaviors are not acceptable in our learning spaces, 
and a process for reporting a code of conduct violation. 
Importantly, providing contact details for a secondary reporting person is 
important, in case the person listed as the reporting person
(unintentionally) violates the code of conduct. 
Furthermore, when a code of conduct violation is reported, 
it is critical that the violation be addressed. 
Upholding a code of conduct can be challenging, 
and sometimes requires difficult and uncomfortable conversations.
However, without addressing violations, 
the Code of Conduct merely becomes a facade.

Another way to scaffold a respectful and supportive community in the data 
science classroom is through careful choice of data sets. 
Consciously avoiding the use of data sets 
that may cause negative emotional reactions
in learners is creates a space where all learners can focus on the data science
concept, tool, workflow being taught in the lesson, without having to 
suppress or cope with negative emotions. 
For example, avoid data sets that involve violent and/or sex crimes,
body weight, gender coded as a binary variable and eugenics. 
Yes, these topics can be important to research, 
however most of the time they are not needed in data science classroom 
when teaching concepts such as classification, version control, et cetera.
If such as data set cannot be avoided for some reason, 
it is better to call awareness to it's challenges or short-comings 
and address why they are so.

There is one exception to this suggestion to avoid data sets 
that cause negative emotional reactions, 
which is when teaching data science ethics, we often need to use real-world
case studies to motivate and engage students in learning about how
to carryout out data science in an honest, ethical and fair way.
However, even when teaching data science ethics, 
selection and presentation of these cases need care and effort.
Choosing the case that will elicit the minimally needed 
amount of negative emotions to motivate the topic, 
as well as providing a rich description of the context of the case,
should be the chosen course of action.

Another way is to engage students in formal/professional training
on how to work and communicate with others in a respectful manner.
Many universities have an equity and inclusion office that runs training courses,
and where those do not exist, there are independent organizations that 
run such courses (e.g., Ally Skills Workshop by Framework Consulting).
We recommend offering these courses to students during orientation days/weeks 
before the beginning of the program, when enthusiasm for the program is high, 
the culture of your cohort is being formed.
