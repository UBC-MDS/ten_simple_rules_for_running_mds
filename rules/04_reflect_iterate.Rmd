Create space and time for reflection on course and program effectiveness, 
and when weaknesses are identified, act on improving them. 
Just like a data science project, iteration is critical process for improvement.
It is naive to think that a data science course or program would be 
optimally effective in its first instance.

Furthermore, given how the field rapidly evolves and changes, 
iteration might be required even after a course or program 
has settled into a period of effectiveness. 
Reflection is critical for identifying when iteration is needed, 
and then willingness to act is critical to implement the necessary changes.
In the UBC MDS program, we have three main avenues for collecting feedback
and reflecting on what course and program improvements we might need to make:

1. student-elected student representatives

2. student surveys

3. academic retreats

One way we obtain feedback is through student-elected student representatives. 
During each course block in MDS, the student body is asked to elect two 
student block representatives. 
The role of these student representatives is to facilitate and encourage
communication and feedback from students to the teaching team in a more informal
and student-driven way. 
The student representatives are encouraged to bring forward any issues/concerns 
the student body has with the MDS program or courses to the teaching team 
if/as they arise through a private messaging channel 
on our Slack course discussion forum, 
and each block they are invited to a meeting with the MDS teaching 
and operations team (including the program directors) 
midway through the block. 
Most student block representatives design and carryout their own surveys ahead
of these block meetings to gather feedback from the wider student body to 
bring to the attention of the teaching team. 
The feedback received from student block representatives in MDS was extremely 
useful during the first several years of the program, when we launched 24 newly
developed one-credit courses. Through this feedback we quickly learned when
courses were presenting material at the wrong pace, when workloads exceeded
student capacity given the deadlines, what topics students found most challenging, 
as well as what pedagogies were most and least effective from the student 
perspectives. 

Finally, we send out surveys to our students upon graduation and at several 
other time periods post graduation (GET CORRECT TIMES AND INSERT HERE).
These surveys provide a different perspective than the feedback from the 
student-elected block representatives, as these surveys are performed at the 
end of the program, and while students are (ideally) working in the field of 
data science. The survey feedback has been most useful in identifying
areas where we initially did not place enough emphasis
as well as new/arising topics in the field of data science.

Twice a year, MDS holds a half-day academic retreat where the instructors 
who taught courses over the previous term meet and reflect on what went well
with their courses, what could be improved. 
Time for discussion around what could be improved, 
and how that cuts across courses to make a more cohesive program is emphasized.
Through these retreats we have identified missing or ill-assumed prerequisite 
knowledge, course ordering issues, pedagogical inconsistencies and more.
Course instructors have valuable insight into what is taught and how it is 
delivered, that is distinct and complementary to that of students. 
These academic retreats also help build relationships and community within
our course instructors.
At the end of each retreat, we build an actionable list of action items to 
be worked on in individual courses, and at the program-level.

Finally, we create time/space in our teaching team's workload to act on 
the identified needs for course and program redevelopment.
Currently, we identify 2-3 courses that are in need of iteration each year,
and during our teaching load assignments, give extra time to the instructors 
assigned to teaching those courses. 
This means they teach less courses that year. 
We also make sure to do this well before the academic year starts so that the 
instructor can find reasonable time to do this important work.
It is a cost for the program, in terms of resources, but it pays off in dividends 
in regards to the benefits it brings for student learning.
