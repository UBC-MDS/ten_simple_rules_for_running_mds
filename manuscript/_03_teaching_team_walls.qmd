Build a interdisciplinary, cohesive core teaching team. Why interdisciplinary? Data science spans many disciplines, and it's very hard to be an expert in everything. We like to joke that the only people who know everything in the MDS curriculum are the MDS alumni! Therefore, an interdisciplinary teaching team is critical in providing expertise across data science. Our MDS program is an equal partnership between the UBC Departments of Computer Science and Statistics; thus, our teaching team draws heavily from these two fields. However, our core team members come from a much wider array of backgrounds: neuroscience, biomedical engineering, climate science, economics, and more. It is through this interdisciplinary teaching team that we are able to deliver such a broad curriculum. In addition, it is a joy and privilege to learn from one another within the team.

Why cohesive? The above paragraph speaks to the breadth of data science. When a curriculum is broad, it is particularly susceptible to feeling fragmented. When students learn about feature selection in machine learning, have they already seen that topic in a statistics course, perhaps under a different name? When students log in to remote machines in their cloud computing course, have they already learned best practices of authentication and security in their databases course? The list of connections goes on. To deliver an excellent data science program, instructors need to be aware of what was taught in earlier courses, and furthermore instructors need an awareness of the big picture to make connections where applicable. In our MDS program, we achieve this with a core teaching team of 6-8 faculty and postdocs from whom MDS teaching is our primary work. Our team meets as a group weekly and we stay in close contact regarding all the courses. In addition to cohesion across disciplines, this approach also creates a more cohesive experience for the students in terms of teaching style and course organization.
