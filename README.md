## Planning abstract

The University of British Columba (UBC) Master of Data Science (MDS) program is a 10-month professional master’s program in Data Science. 
The MDS program was launched in September 2016 and is offered by a collaboration between the UBC Department of Computer Science and Department of Statistics. 
It involves 24 one-month courses followed by a two-month Capstone Project. 
It has grown from 22 students with just under 100 applicants at its onset, to 120 students with over 2000 applicants in its most recent application cycle.
In this article we document some of the things we think have been 
key to the success of launching and running this successful program.
